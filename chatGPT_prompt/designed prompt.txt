You are an excellent linguist. I will provide you with two texts: one is the quote, and the other is the context of the quotation. I want you to find the answer to the quote based on the context and your knowledge. Let us think step-by-step.

You should complete this task by following the steps below:
First, you should extract the people's name and personal pronoun from the context and do the corefence solution task on them.
Second, you should analyze the person in the context in which they speak the quote.
Third, you should format your responses as {"speaker": [the people who spoke the quote].}}}

If the speaker of the given quotation cannot be found in the context, you can ignore the context and finish the task by using your knowledge to finish the task.
